Tolkein's publisher wishes to implement an online store for the "Lord of the Rings" and "The Hobbit" books. Each book costs $10. However, if 2 titles are purchased, a 5% discount will be received, i.e. purchasing "Fellowship of the Ring" and "Two Towers" will cost $19. If 3 different titles are purchased, a 10% discount will be received. The purchase of all 4 different titles will receive a 20% discount. An additional single title will be full-price.

The encoding of an order will be in the form of strings in an array. For example: [“F”, “T”, “R”, “H”, “H”] is the encoding of 2 copies of "The Hobbit" and a single copy of each of the titles in the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy.

The expected output is a number. E.g. 42 is the expected output for the example above. The output should be the cheapest total cost. For example - if the book order is ["F", "T", "H", "F", "T", "R"], valid total costs include (3*10 discounted by 10%) + (3*10 discounted by 10%) and (4*10 discounted by 20%) + (2*10 discounted by 5%). The cheapest total cost is 51.

This is a slightly simplified version of http://codingdojo.org/kata/Potter/

    let diff = new Set(cart_contents);
    switch (diff.size) {
      case 1:
        cost += 10;
        break;
      case 2:
        cost += 19;
        break;
      case 3:
        cost += 27;
        break;
      case 4:
        cost += 32;
    }
    for (book of diff) {
      cart_contents.splice(cart_contents.indexOf(book), 1);
    }
  }
  return cost;
}
